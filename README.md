Prototype of primitive engine for prototyping

## philosophy

- IRL: game = player is using App in rintime,
- App: game is sequence of *stages* and *transitions*, and my responsabilities includes signal processing and termination handling,
- Engine: game is a *room*, which is serving by *controllers*
- Gameplay controller: game is a flow of computations
- Assets: game? what game?
